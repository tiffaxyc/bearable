            <p>Bear has been feeling down lately. 
                In fact, for the past few days, Bear has not been paw-sitive about anything! 
                First, Bear's jar of honey got stolen, then there was a bear-y big argument with Bear's favorite
                bear, and now Bear's got a haircut that has left her feeling like a frozen, fuzzy popsicle! </p>
            <p>Why don't we accompany Bear in self-care practices for a more bear-able day? </p>

                In fact, Bear's sleeping timer claims Bear has slept for only 2 hours a day! </p>
            </p>How has your sleep schedule been? Have you slept for less than 8 hours last night 
                and/or woke up frequently? If so, go take a nap! Bear is napping right now!</p>
